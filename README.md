# Unification-Algorithm
This is an implementation of Unification Algorithm in C++

There are a lot of implementation of Unification Algorithm written in different languages, but I could not find one written in C++. So, I have written one here.

## Compiling and running the program
Run the program with the following command
```bash
g++ Unification.cpp -o run
```
After compilation, run the executable file with the command
```bash
./run
```
